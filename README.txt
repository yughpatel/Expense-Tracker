Hello there! Welcome to the Expense Tracker by Yug.
This is a simple program to help you keep track of your money. Don't worry, it's very easy to use! All your data is saved in a simple transactions.csv file that you can even open with Excel.

Getting Started (Just 2 Simple Steps!)
Step 1: Install Python

If you don't have Python on your computer, you can get it from the official website: python.org

When you install it, please make sure to check the little box that says "Add Python to PATH". This will make things much easier!

Step 2: Install the Charting Tool

This program uses a cool tool called Matplotlib to draw charts. To install it, you'll need to use the Command Prompt.

Open your Command Prompt (you can find it by searching for "cmd" in the Start Menu).

First, navigate to the folder where you saved this project. For example, if it's on your Desktop, you would type this and press Enter:
cd Desktop\Expense Tracker by Yug

Once you're in the right folder, just run this simple command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

And you're all set! That's all the setup you need.

How to Run Your Program
Make sure you have your Command Prompt open and you are in the project folder.

To start the expense tracker, just type this command and press Enter:
